# Chat-Application-SignalR

Simple Chat Application using SignalR

You can pick a username and chat in real-time with your friends.
The application can be used through network, but it needs a database where to store the messages and a domain name.
I hosted the application on Azure for one month, but my license expired so is no longer available.
If you have an available database or domain name you can host it on your own. Just uncomment the specific lines from ChatHub.cs.
